# openHAB Demo App

See the [documentation about the demo app](https://www.openhab.org/docs/developer/ide/generic.html).

The demo app can be started from Eclipse.
Alternatively, run the command "mvn bnd-run:run" on the console.

If the dependencies do not resolve, lauch.bndrun may miss an update.
Resolver can be triggered by the command "mvn install -DwithResolver" on the console.
Please open a PR on GitHub in case this happens for unmodified installs.
